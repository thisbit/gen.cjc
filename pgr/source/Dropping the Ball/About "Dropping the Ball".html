<title>About "Dropping the Ball"</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This poem was written by Nick Montfort for New Year's 2011-2012.
  The generator that produces the boundless poem "Dropping the Ball" 
  changes its behavior every year at midnight on New Year's. The content
  terms are drawn uniformly at random from a list of 150 words.
  During odd-numbered years, the last letter of these words is dropped;
  during even-numbered years, the first letter is dropped. The 150
  words are approximately all of the words in English that (1) can
  be inflected with "-s," (2) remain English words without their last
  letter, and (3) remain English words without their first letter.</p>
  <p>If you miss watching the poem change at the end of this New
  Year's Eve, try it at the end of another year.</p>
