REGULATORY COOPERATION
Scope
This Chapter applies to the development, review and methodological aspects of regulatory measures of the Parties’ regulatory authorities that are covered by, among others, the TBT Agreement, the SPS Agreement, the GATTthe GATS, and Chapters Four Technical Barriers to Trade, Five Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Nine Cross-Border Trade in Services, Twenty-Two Trade and Sustainable Development, Twenty-Three Trade and Labour and Twenty-Four Trade and Environment.
Principles
The Parties reaffirm their rights and obligations with respect to regulatory measures under the TBT Agreement, the SPS Agreement, the GATT  and the GATS.
The Parties are committed to ensure high levels of protection for human, animal and plant life or health, and the environment in accordance with the TBT Agreement, the SPS Agreement, the GATTthe GATS, and this Agreement.
The Parties recognise the value of regulatory cooperation with their relevant trading partners both bilaterally and multilaterally. The Parties will, whenever practicable and mutually beneficial, approach regulatory cooperation inway that is open to participation by other international trading partners.
Without limiting the ability of each Party to carry out its regulatory, legislative and policy activities, the Parties are committed to further develop regulatory cooperation in light of their mutual interest in order to
 prevent and eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade and investment
 enhance the climate for competitiveness and innovation, including by pursuing regulatory compatibility, recognition of equivalence, and convergence and
 promote transparent, efficient and effective regulatory processes that support public policy objectives and fulfil the mandates of regulatory bodies, including through the promotion of information exchange and enhanced use of best practices.
This Chapter replaces the Framework on Regulatory Co-operation and Transparency between the Government of Canada and the European Commission, done at Brussels on  Decemberand governs the activities previously undertaken in the context of that Framework.
The Parties may undertake regulatory cooperation activities onvoluntary basis. For greater certainty,Party is not required to enter into any particular regulatory cooperation activity, and may refuse to cooperate or may withdraw from cooperation. However, ifParty refuses to initiate regulatory cooperation or withdraws from
cooperation, it should be prepared to explain the reasons for its decision to the other Party.

 consulting with each other, as appropriate, and exchanging information throughout the regulatory development process. This consultation and exchange should begin as early as possible in that process
 sharing non-public information to the extent that this information may be made available to foreign governments in accordance with the applicable rules of the Party providing the information
 sharing proposed technical or sanitary and phytosanitary regulations that may have an impact on trade with the other Party at the earliest stage possible so that comments and proposals for amendments may be taken into account
 providing, upon request by the other Party,copy of the proposed regulation, subject to applicable privacy law, and allow sufficient time for interested parties to provide comments in writing
 exchanging information about contemplated regulatory actions, measures or amendments under consideration, at the earliest stage possible, in order to
 understand the rationale behindParty’s regulatory choices, including the instrument choice, and examine the possibilities for greater convergence between the Parties on how to state the objectives of regulations and how to define their scope. The Parties should also address the interface between regulations, standards and conformity assessment in this context and
 compare methods and assumptions used to analyse regulatory proposals, including, when appropriate, an analysis of technical or economic practicability and the benefits in relation to the objective pursued of any major alternative regulatory requirements or approaches considered. This information exchange may also include compliance strategies and impact assessments, includingcomparison of the potential cost-effectiveness of the regulatory proposal to that of major alternative regulatory requirements or approaches considered
 examining opportunities to minimise unnecessary divergences in regulations through means such as
 conductingconcurrent or joint risk assessment andregulatory impact assessment if practicable and mutually beneficial
 achievingharmonised, equivalent or compatible solution or
 considering mutual recognition in specific cases
 cooperating on issues that concern the development, adoption, implementation and maintenance of international standards, guides and recommendations
 examining the appropriateness and possibility of collecting the same or similar data about the nature, extent and frequency of problems that may potentially give rise to regulatory action when it would expedite making statistically significant judgments about those problems

Declaration of the Parties concerning tariff rate quota administration
Declaration concerning European Union administration for beef and veal, and pork tariff rate quotas under this Agreement
The general principle is that tariff rate quota administration should be as conducive to trade as possible. More specifically, it must not impair or nullify the market access commitments negotiated by the Parties it must be transparent, predictable, minimise transactional costs for traders, maximise fill rates and aim to avoid potential speculation.
Structure of the import licensing system
Quarterly sub-periods with carryover between periods for unused tariff rate quota quantities
In each of the four quarters of the marketing year,  per cent of the annual tariff rate quota quantity will be made available for licence applications.
Any quantities remaining available at the end of one quarter will be automatically rolled over into the subsequent quarter until the end of the marketing year.
Application period for import licences
An application for an import licence will be accepted up to  calendar days preceding the beginning of each quarter and an import licence shall be issued no less than  calendar days before the quarter begins.
If demand for licences during the application period exceeds the quantities available for that quarter, licences will be allocated onpro-rated basis.
If the available quantity for any quarter is not fully allocated during the application period, the remaining quantity will be made available for eligible applicants to apply for on demand for the rest of that quarter. Import licences will be issued automatically on demand until the available quantity has been fully subscribed for that period.
Validity of licences
An import licence is valid
 from the date of issue or the date of the beginning of the quarter for which the import licence is issued, whichever is later and
 for five months from the applicable date in subparagraph  or until the end of the marketing year, whichever comes first.
Import licences may be used at any European Union customs entry point and for multiple shipments.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria and allocation method should result in the quotas going to those persons that are most likely to use it and must not create barriers to imports.
During the application period, eligible applicants shall include historical importers of beef, bison or veal for beef and veal imports and historical importers of beef, bison, veal or pork for pork imports.
In any quarter following the application period when licences are made available on demand, the eligibility criteria for applicants will be expanded to include wholesalers and accredited meat processors.
Securities
Securities tied to import licence applications
security of not more than  euro  per tonne of beef and  euro  per tonne of pork will be lodged with the application forlicence.
Transfer of licence and corresponding security
Licences are not transferable.
Return of licence and corresponding security
Unused licence quantities may be returned before expiration and up to four months prior to the end of the marketing year. Each licence holder may return up to  per cent of their individual licence quantity. When suchquantity is returned,  per cent of the corresponding security is released.
All returned quantities will be immediately made available to other eligible applicants to apply for on demand for the rest of that quarter, and will be rolled over to subsequent quarters if not requested.
Release of security and release of full security when  per cent of imports occur
Securities shall be proportionally released each time actual imports have taken place.
Once  per cent of an importer’s individual licence quantity is actually imported the full security shall be released.
Declaration concerning Canada’s administration for cheese tariff rate quotas under this Agreement
The general principle is that tariff rate quota administration should be as conducive to trade as possible. More specifically, it must not impair or nullify the market access commitments negotiated by the Parties it must be transparent, predictable, minimise transactional costs for traders, maximise fill rates and aim to avoid potential speculation.
The eligibility criteria and allocation method should result in the quotas going to those persons that are most likely to use it and must not create barriers to imports.
Structure of the import licensing system
The annual tariff rate quota quantity will be allocated each year among eligible applicants.
The tariff rate quota allocation method will allow for new entrants each year. During the phase-in period from Year  to Yearat least  per cent of the tariff rate quota will be available to new entrants every year. After the end of the phase-in period from Year  and in subsequent years, at least  percent of the tariff rate quota quantity will be available for new entrants.
The tariff rate quota quantity will be allocated oncalendar year basis. Applications from all interested parties will be received and processed according to the provisions of the Understanding on Tariff Rate Quota Administration Provisions of Agricultural Products, as defined in Article  of the Agreement on Agriculture, Ministerial Decision WTMIN,  Decemberwithperiod of four to six weeks to submit applications. Imports will be able to start from the first day of the year.
In the event that the tariff rate quota is not fully allocated following the application process in paragraphavailable quantities will immediately be offered to eligible applicants in proportion to their allocation, or on demand if quantities still remain after the first offer.
Eligibility criteria
To be eligible, an applicant shall be, atminimum,resident of Canada and be active in the Canadian cheese sector regularly during the year.
During the phase-in period from Year  to Yeara new entrant shall be an eligible applicant who is not an allocation holder under Canada’s cheese tariff rate quota under the WTO.
After the end of the phase-in period, from Year  and in subsequent years,new entrant shall be an eligible applicant who is not an allocation holder under Canada’s cheese tariff rate quota under the WTO or did not receive an allocation of the tariff rate quotas under this Agreement in the preceding year.
new entrant shall be considered as such forperiod of three years.
Once an applicant is no longer considered to benew entrant, the applicant shall be treated the same as all other applicants.
Canada may consider limiting the size of allocations tospecific percentage if it is deemed necessary to fostercompetitive, fair, and balanced import environment.
Use of import allocations and import permits
tariff rate quota allocation shall be valid for one quota year or, if issued after the beginning of the quota year, for the remainder of the quota year.
To ensure that imports are aligned with domestic market conditions and to minimise barriers to trade, an allocation holder will normally be free to use its allocation to import any product covered by the tariff rate quota at any time during the year.
On the basis of its allocation, an importer will submit an import permit request for each shipment of product covered by the tariff rate quota that the importer seeks to import into Canada. Import permits are normally issued automatically upon request through the electronic permitting system of the Government of Canada. Under current policies, import permits may be requested up to  days before the planned date of entry and are valid forperiod of five days before and  days from the date of entry.
Permits are not transferable.
An import permit may be amended or cancelled.
transfer of allocations may be authorised.
An allocation holder that uses less than  per cent of its allocation in any one year may be subject to an under-utilisation penalty in the following year, in which it will receive an allocation that reflects the actual level of use of the previous allocation. An allocation holder affected by an under-utilisation penalty will be advised prior to the final allocation of the tariff rate quota.
An allocation holder may return an unused quantity of their allocation up tospecified date. Returned quantities will be considered used for the purpose of the application of the under-utilisation penalty. Chronic returns may be penalised.
Returned quantities will normally be made available to interested allocation holders who have not returned any unused quantity of their allocation the day after the return deadline. If quantities remain after that, they may be offered to other interested third parties.
The return deadline will be set atdate that is early enough to give sufficient time for use of the returned quantities, while being late enough to allow allocation holders to establish their import needs until the end of the year, possibly near the middle of the quota year.

EXPROPRIATION
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that
Expropriation may be direct or indirect
 direct expropriation occurs when an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure and
 indirect expropriation occurs ifmeasure or series of measures ofParty has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation, in that it substantially deprives the investor of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
The determination of whethermeasure or series of measures ofParty, inspecific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requirescase-by-case, fact-based inquiry that takes into consideration, among other factors
 the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact thatmeasure or series of measures ofParty has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred
 the duration of the measure or series of measures ofParty
 the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations and
 the character of the measure or series of measures, notably their object, context and intent.
For greater certainty, except in the rare circumstance when the impact ofmeasure or series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive, non-discriminatory measures ofParty that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.
For the purposes of this Annex,
 -B PUBLICnegotiated restructuring means the restructuring or rescheduling of debt ofParty that has been effected through
modification or amendment of debt instruments, as provided for under their terms, including, their governing law, or
debt exchange or other similar process in which the holders of no less than  per cent of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt subject to restructuring have consented to such debt exchange or other process and
governing law ofdebt instrument meansjurisdiction’s laws applicable to that debt instrument.
No claim thatrestructuring of debt ofParty breaches an obligation under Sectionsandmay be submitted to, or if already submitted continue under Sectionif the restructuring isnegotiated restructuring at the time of submission, or becomesnegotiated restructuring after such submission, except forclaim that the restructuring violates Articleor.
Notwithstanding Article. and subject to paragraphan investor ofParty may not submitclaim under Sectionthatrestructuring of debt ofParty breaches an obligation under Sectionsandother than Articleor unless  days have elapsed from the date of submission by the claimant of the written request for consultations pursuant to Article.
For greater certainty, debt ofParty meansdebt instrument of any level of government ofParty.
 For greater certainty, mere differences in treatment accorded byParty to certain investors or investments on the basis of legitimate policy objectives in the context ofdebt crisis or threat thereof, including those differences in treatment resulting from eligibility for debt restructuring, do not amount tobreach of Articleor.
EXCLUSIONS FROM DISPUTE SETTLEMENT
decision by Canada followingreview under the Investment Canada Act, c.  st Supp regarding whether or not to permit an investment that is subject to review, is not subject to the dispute settlement provisions under Section F, or to Chapter Twenty-Nine Dispute Settlement. For greater certainty, this exclusion is without prejudice to the right ofParty to have recourse to Chapter Twenty-Nine Dispute Settlement with respect to the consistency ofmeasure withParty’s reservations, as set out in the Party’s Schedule to Annexes I, II or III, as appropriate.
JOINT DECLARATION CONCERNING ARTICLE.
Mindful that investor-State dispute settlement tribunals are meant to enforce the obligations referred to in Article and are not an appeal mechanism for the decisions of domestic courts, the Parties recall that the domestic courts of each Party are responsible for the determination of the existence and validity of intellectual property rights. The Parties further recognise that each Party shall be free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of this Agreement regarding intellectual property within their own legal system and practice. The Parties agree to review the relation between intellectual property rights and investment disciplines within three years after entry into force of this Agreement or at the request ofParty. Further to this review and to the extent required, the Parties may issue binding interpretations to ensure the proper interpretation of the scope of investment protection under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article
JOINT DECLARATION ON ARTICLESWith respect to Articles,Denial of benefits andNational security, the Parties confirm their understanding that measures that are “related to the maintenance of international peace and security” include the protection of human rights.
DECLARATION BY CANADA ON THE INVESTMENT CANADACanada will increase the threshold for review under the Investment Canada Act, c.  st Supp. “ICA” to CAD $. billion once this Agreement is implemented.
Any future amendments to the ICA would be subject to the requirement that such amendments could not decrease the conformity of the ICA with the investment obligations of this Agreement.
As set out in Canada’s ICA reservation Annex , the higher threshold will apply to an acquisition ofCanadian enterprise by an investor of the European Union that is notstate enterprise. The determination of whether the acquirer is an investor of the European Union would be based on whethernational of the European Union controls the acquirer in law, or in the absence ofmajority ownership, whether nationals of the European Union control the acquirer in fact such as through the ownership of voting interests or through the nationality of members of the board of directors. Moreover, enterprises of the European Union that are controlled by nationals from Canada’s existing Free Trade Agreement partners with which Canada has taken investment commitments would also benefit from the higher threshold.
Canada will amend its ICA to provide for the changes necessary for the higher review threshold stated above upon the entry into force of this Agreement.

 -A GUIDELINES FOR MRAs
Introduction
This Annex contains guidelines to provide practical guidance to facilitate the negotiation of MRAs with respect to regulated professions. These guidelines are non-binding and they do not modify or affect the rights and obligations ofParty under this Agreement.
Definitions
For the purposes of this Annex
adaptation period meansperiod of supervised practice, possibly accompanied by further training, ofregulated profession in the host jurisdiction under the responsibility ofqualified person. This period of supervised practice shall be subject to an assessment. The detailed rules governing the adaptation period, its assessment and the professional status of the person under supervision shall be set out, as appropriate, in the host jurisdiction’s law
aptitude test meanstest limited to the professional knowledge of applicants, made by the relevant authorities of the host jurisdiction with the aim of assessing the ability of applicants to pursueregulated profession in that jurisdiction and
scope of practice means an activity or group of activities covered byregulated profession.
Form and Content of theThis Section sets out various issues that may be addressed innegotiation and, if so agreed, included in final MRAs. It outlines elements that might be required of foreign professionals seeking to benefit from an MRA.
Participants
The parties to the MRA should be clearly stated.Purpose of theThe purpose of the MRA should be clearly stated.Scope of theThe MRA should set out clearly
 the scope of the MRA, in terms of the specific professional titles and activities which it covers
 who is entitled to use the professional titles concerned
 whether the recognition mechanism is based on formal qualifications,licence obtained in the jurisdiction of origin, or on some other requirement and
 whether the MRA allows temporary or permanent access to the profession concerned.
Mutual Recognition Provisions
The MRA should clearly specify the conditions to be met for the recognition of qualifications in each jurisdiction and the level of equivalence agreed.
The following four-step process should be considered to simplify and facilitate the recognition of the qualifications.
Four-Step Process for the Recognition of Qualifications
Step One Verification of Equivalency
The negotiating entities should verify the overall equivalence of the scopes of practice or
qualifications of the regulated profession in their respective jurisdictions.
The examination of qualifications should include the collection of all relevant information pertaining to the scope of practice rights related tolegal competency to practice or to the qualifications required forspecific regulated profession in the respective jurisdictions.
Consequently, the negotiating entities should
 identify activities or groups of activities covered by the scope of practice rights of the regulated profession and
 identify the qualifications required in each jurisdiction. These may include the following elements
 the minimum level of education required, for example, entry requirements, length of study and subjects studied
 the minimum level of experience required, for example, location, length and conditions of practical training or supervised professional practice prior to licensing, or the framework of ethical and disciplinary standards
 examinations passed, especially examinations of professional competency
 the extent to which qualifications from one jurisdiction are recognised in the other jurisdiction and
 the qualifications which the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction are prepared to recognise, for instance, by listing particular diplomas or certificates issued, or by reference to particular minimum requirements to be certified by the relevant authorities of the jurisdiction of origin, including whether the possession ofcertain level of qualification would allow recognition for some activities of the scope of practice but not others level and length of education, major educational focuses, overall subjects and areas.
There is an overall equivalence between the scope of practice rights or the qualifications of the regulated profession if there are no substantial differences in this regard between jurisdictions.
Step Two Evaluation of Substantial Differences
There existssubstantial difference in the scope of qualifications required to practiceregulated profession, in cases of
 important differences in the essential knowledge or
 significant differences in the duration or content of the training between the jurisdictions.
There existssubstantial difference in the scope of practice if
 one or more professional activities do not form part of the corresponding profession in the jurisdiction of origin
 these activities are subject to specific training in the host jurisdiction and,
 the training for these activities in the host jurisdiction covers substantially different matters from those covered by the applicant’s qualification.
Step Three Compensatory Measures
If the negotiating entities determine that there issubstantial difference in the scope of practice rights or of qualifications between the jurisdictions, they may determine compensatory measures to bridge the gap.
compensatory measure may take the form of, among other things, an adaptation period or, if required, an aptitude test.
Compensatory measures should be proportionate to the substantial difference which they seek to address. The negotiating entities should also evaluate any practical professional experience obtained in the jurisdiction of origin to see whether this experience is sufficient to remedy, in whole or in part, the substantial difference in the scope of practice rights or qualifications between the jurisdictions, prior to determiningcompensatory measure.
Step Four Identification of the Conditions for Recognition
Once the assessment of the overall equivalency of the scopes of practice rights or qualifications of the regulated profession is completed, the negotiating entities should specify in the the legal competency required to practice the regulated profession
 the qualifications for the regulated profession
 whether compensatory measures are necessary
 the extent to which professional experience may compensate for substantial differences
description of any compensatory measure, including the use of any adaptation period or aptitude test.
Mechanisms for Implementation The MRA should state
 the rules and procedures to be used to monitor and enforce the provisions of the agreement
 the mechanisms for dialogue and administrative co-operation between the parties to the MRA and
 the means for individual applicants to address any matters arising from the interpretation or implementation of the MRA.

 information will be supplied on any assistance programmes in the host jurisdiction for practical training, and any commitments of the host jurisdiction in that context.
Licensing and Other Provisions in the Host Jurisdiction

Any licensing requirements other than qualifications should be explained, including requirements relating to
 having an office address, maintaining an establishment or beingresident
 language skills
 proof of good character

Furthermore, measures of Member States of the European Union restricting or prohibiting cross-border portfolio management including reservations in its Schedules to Annexesand II shall no longer apply to this commitment.
UNDERSTANDING ON THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES.The Parties recognise that prudential measures strengthen domestic financial systems, encourage sound, efficient and robust institutions, markets and infrastructure, and promote international financial stability by facilitating better-informed lending and investment decisions, improving market integrity and reducing the risks of financial distress and contagion.
Asresult, the Parties have agreed toprudential carve-out in Article. allowing the Parties to adopt or maintain measures for prudential reasons, and have providedrole for the Financial Services Committee, established pursuant to Article in determining whether, and if so, to what extent the prudential carve out applies in investment disputes in financial services pursuant to Article.
Process relating to The Financial Services Committee, in its role in investment disputes pursuant to Article, shall decide whether and, if so, to what extent the prudential carve-out isvalid defence toclaim.
The Parties undertake to act in good faith. Each Party shall present its position to the Financial Services Committee within  days of the referral to the Financial Services Committee.
If the non-disputing Party notifies the Financial Services Committee within the  day period in paragraph  that it has launched an internal determination process on this matter, the period of time referred to in paragraph  is suspended until that Party notifies the Financial Services Committee of its position.suspension beyond six months is considered asbreach of the good faith undertaking.
If the respondent does not provide its position to the Financial Services Committee within the period of time referred to in paragraphthe suspension of the periods of time or proceedings referred to in Article. no longer applies and the investor may proceed with its claim.
If the Financial Services Committee is unable to adoptdecision onjoint determination within  days in relation tospecific investor-state dispute concerningprudential measure, the Financial Services Committee shall refer the matter to the CETA Joint Committee. This period of  days commences from the moment the Financial Services Committee receives the positions of the Parties pursuant to paragraph
The joint determination of the Financial Services Committee or of the CETA Joint Committee is binding on the Tribunal only in the dispute in question. The joint
Each Party shall ensure that its representation in the CETA Joint Commission for this purpose includes financial services authorities.
determination does not constitutebinding precedent for the Parties with respect to the scope and application of the prudential carve-out or other terms of this Agreement.
Unless the CETA Joint Committee decides otherwise, if the CETA Joint Committee does not reach an agreement within three months ofreferral of the matter by the Financial Services Committee pursuant to paragrapheach Party shall make its position available to the Tribunal that arbitrates the dispute in question. The Tribunal shall take into account this record in reachingdecision.
High level principles
The Parties agree that the application of Article. by the Parties and by tribunals should be guided by the following principles, which are not exhaustive
 Party may determine its own appropriate level of prudential regulation. Specifically,Party may establish and enforce measures that providehigher level of prudential protection than those set out in common international prudential commitments
 relevant considerations in determining whethermeasure meets the requirements of Article. include the extent to whichmeasure may be required by the urgency of the situation and the information available to the Party at the time when the measure was adopted
 given the highly specialised nature of prudential regulation, those applying these principles shall defer to the highest degree possible to regulations and practices in the Parties’ respective jurisdictions and to the decisions and factual determinations, including risk assessments,made by financial regulatory authorities
except as provided in subparagraph ,measure is deemed to meet the requirements of Article. if it
 hasprudential objective and
 is not so severe in light of its purpose that it is manifestly disproportionate to the attainment of its objective and
measure that otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraph  does not meet the requirements of Article. if it isdisguised restriction on foreign investment or an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investors in like situations
 provided thatmeasure is not applied inmanner which would constitutemeans of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investors in like situations, ordisguised restriction on foreign investment, that measure is deemed to meet the requirements of Article. if it is
 in line with international prudential commitments that are common to the Parties
 in pursuance of the resolution offinancial institution that is no longer viable or likely to be no longer viable
 in pursuance of the recovery offinancial institution or the management offinancial institution under stress or
 in pursuance of the preservation or the restoration of financial stability, in response tosystem-wide financial crisis.
Periodic Review
The Financial Services Committee may, by consent of both Parties, amend this Understanding at any time. The Financial Services Committee should review this Understanding at least every two years.
In this context, the Financial Services Committee may developcommon understanding on the application of Article on the basis of the dialogue and discussions held in the Committee in relation to specific disputes and mindful of international prudential commitments that are common to the Parties.
UNDERSTANDING ON THE DIALOGUE ON THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
The Parties reaffirm their commitment to strengthening financial stability. The dialogue on the regulation of the financial services sector within the Financial Services Committee shall be based on the principles and prudential standards agreed at the multilateral level. The Parties undertake to focus the discussion on issues with cross-border impact, such as cross- border trade in securities including the possibility of taking further commitments on portfolio management, the respective frameworks for covered bonds and for collateral requirements in reinsurance, and to discuss issues related to the operation of branches.

Notes to the European Union’s Annex -
For procuring entities covered under Annex  the thresholds will be SDRwhen an entity procures consulting services regarding matters ofconfidential nature, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to compromise government confidences, cause economic disruption or similarly be contrary to public interest.
This Chapter does not apply to services which entities have to procure from another entity pursuant to an exclusive right established bypublished law, regulation or administrative provision.

PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN
Introductory Notes to Annex
This Annex sets out the conditions required forproduct to be considered originating within the meaning of Article  Sufficient Production.
The following definitions apply
chapter meanschapter of the Harmonized System
heading means any four-digit number, or the first four digits of any number, used in the Harmonized System
section meanssection of the Harmonized System and
subheading means any six-digit number, or the first six digits of any number, used
in the Harmonized System.
The product-specific rule of origin, or set of rules of origin, that applies toproduct classified inparticular heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings is set out immediately adjacent to that heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings.
Unless otherwise specified,requirement ofchange in tariff classification or any other condition set out inproduct-specific rule of origin applies only to non- originating material.
Section, chapter, heading, or subheading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of each new section, chapter, heading, or subheading. These notes must be read in conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin for the applicable section, chapter, heading, or subheading and may impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative to, the product-specific rules of origin.
Unless otherwise specified, reference to weight inproduct-specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the weight ofmaterial orproduct not including the weight of packaging as set out in the definitions of “net weight of non-originating material” and “net weight of the product” in Article  Definitions of this Protocol.
reference to non-originating sugar inproduct-specific rule of origin means the non-originating material referred to in Article  Sugar of this Protocol.
Ifproduct-specific rule of origin requires
change from any other chapter, heading, or subheading, orchange to productfrom any other chapter, heading, or subheading, only non- originating material classified inchapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product
change from withinheading or subheading, or from within any one of these headings or subheadings, non-originating material classified within the heading or subheading may be used in the production of the product, as well as non-

originating material classified inchapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product
change from any heading or subheading outsidegroup, only non-originating material classified outside the group of headings or subheadings may be used in the production of the product
 thatproduct is wholly obtained, the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article  Wholly Obtained Products. Ifshipment consists ofnumber of identical products classified under tariff provision x, each product shall be considered separately
 production in which all the material of tariff provisionused is wholly obtained, all of the material of tariff provisionused in production of the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article  Wholly Obtained Products
change from tariff provision x, whether or not there is alsochange from any other chapter, heading or subheading, the value of any non-originating material that satisfies the change in tariff classification specified in the phrase commencing with the words “whether or not” is not considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. If two or more product- specific rules of origin are applicable toheading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings, the change in tariff classification specified in this phrase reflects the change specified in the first rule of origin
 that the value of non-originating materials of tariff provisiondoes not exceedper cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, only the value of the non-originating material specified in this rule of origin is considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article  Tolerance
 that the value of non-originating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product does not exceedper cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, non-originating material classified intariff provision other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product. Only the value of the non-originating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product is considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article  Tolerance
 that the value of all non-originating materials does not exceedper cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, the value of all non- originating materials is considered when calculating the value of non- originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non- originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article  Tolerance and
 that the net weight of non-originating material of tariff provisionused in production does not exceedper cent of the net weight of the product, the
specified non-originating materials may be used in the production of the product, provided that it does not exceed the specified percentage of the net weight of the product in accordance with the definition of “net weight of the product” in ArticleThe percentage for the maximum weight of non- originating material as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article  Tolerance.
The product-specific rule of origin represents the minimum amount of production required on non-originating material for the resulting product to achieve originating status.greater amount of production than that required by the product-specific rule of origin for that product also confers originating status.
Ifproduct-specific rule of origin provides thatspecified non-originating material may not be used, or that the value or weight ofspecified non-originating material cannot exceedspecific threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating material classified elsewhere in the Harmonized System.
In accordance with Article  Sufficient Production, whenmaterial obtains originating status in the territory ofParty and this material is further used in the production ofproduct for which origin is being determined, no account will be taken of any non-originating material used in the production of that material. This applies whether or not the material has acquired originating status inside the same factory where the product is produced.
The product-specific rules of origin set out in this Annex also apply to used products.

In all Member States of the EU, services considered as public utilities atnational or local level may be subject to public monopolies or to exclusive rights granted to private operators.
Public utilities exist in sectors such as related scientific and technical consulting services, research and development R&D services on social sciences and humanities, technical testing and analysis services, environmental services, health services, transport services and services auxiliary to all modes of transport. Exclusive rights on such services are often granted to private operators, for instance operators with concessions from public authorities, subject to specific service obligations. Given that public utilities often also exist at the sub-central level, detailed and exhaustive sector-specific scheduling is not practical.
