They were never ours. We tried to catch them. They shapeshift according to the environments they travel through. If you’d try to eat them, they would slip out of your hands like wet clay. Sometimes they turned into ropes, creating a safety net for all of us. Others would hide in the garden, burrowing to protect themselves from hungry travellers. In the depths of soils supporting us, we find refuge in composting shared stories.</p><p>Be welcome to become a part of our ecosystem, as the tasks of shaping, tying, tasting, digging and resting are re-organized and we-organized as we pass on the rhythms. Will you jump with us into the wormholes of the never ending burning garden or do we watch to see whether the winds wait?</p><p>Reframing Climate Colonialism, Pleasuring the Radical Imagination will present different materializations and workshops that spread further what we have been learning in our COOP. As a critique on the exploitation and destruction brought about by climate colonialism, we will present scenes of adaptability, sensuality, reciprocity, webs of care and staying with the trouble.</p><h4 class="project-heading-again sub">Wait, what is this wonky web right here?</h4><p>This web project is a part of the overall CASCO course. It brings together different contributions by students from the group. The main purpose of the web is to programatically "rethink"and reshuffle taughts, ideas and formulations from the CJC document that formed the backbone of our course.</p><footer class="colophon-who"><h5 class="subsub-title project-heading-again">Who's Who?</h5><p class="who">This project has been realised as part of <a href="https://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/15445/2020-2021-study-group-~-reframing-climate-colonialism-pleasuring-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Find out more about the project, the Course and the participating students and tutors." >CASCO COOP course</a>, held at Dutch Art Institute 2020-2021.</p><p class="who">Tutors: Clementine Edwards with Ama Josephine Budge (November-March) and Ying Que (June-October), CJC Working Group for Casco Art Institute: Working for the Commons.</p><p class="who">Students: Mia van den Bos, Dakota Guo, Csilla Klenyanszki, Elvis Krstulović, Emmeli Person, Liza Rinkema, Alexandra Martens Serrano, Raul Silva, Marika Vandekraats</p><h5 class="subsub-title project-heading-again">Notice!</h5><p class="what">This project is an experimental student assignment, optimized for mobile viewing primarily.
